# 3D Interactive Website

A responsive, interactive website featuring 3D elements created using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no external libraries or frameworks.

## Features

- **3D Cube**: Interactive cube that can be rotated via buttons or by dragging with the mouse
- **3D Flip Cards**: Cards that flip on hover with 3D animations
- **3D Carousel**: A circular carousel with 3D perspective
- **3D Form**: Contact form with depth and perspective effects
- **Parallax Effects**: Subtle mouse-based parallax effects
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Live Background**: Animated gradient with floating particles
- **Mobile-Friendly Navigation**: Hamburger menu with smooth animations

## Technical Details

### 3D Techniques Used

- CSS 3D Transforms (`rotateX`, `rotateY`, `translateZ`)
- CSS Perspective and transform-style: preserve-3d
- JavaScript for interactive manipulations of 3D elements
- CSS Transitions and animations for smooth effects
- CSS Custom Properties for parallax effects
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile compatibility

### File Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML document
- `styles.css` - All CSS styling and 3D transforms
- `script.js` - JavaScript for 3D interactions

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Interact with the various 3D elements:
   - Rotate the cube with the buttons or by dragging
   - Hover over the cards to see them flip
   - Use the carousel navigation to rotate the 3D carousel
   - Observe the parallax effects when moving your mouse
   - Fill out the 3D contact form
   - Navigate using the interactive menu

## Browser Compatibility

This website works best in modern browsers that support CSS 3D transforms:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Development and Customization

### Modifying Colors

The main color scheme can be modified by changing the gradient colors in the CSS:
```css
background: linear-gradient(-45deg, #ee7752, #e73c7e, #23a6d5, #23d5ab);
```

### Adding New Elements

The modular structure makes it easy to add new 3D elements by following the existing patterns for perspective, transforms, and interactions.

### Responsive Breakpoints

The site includes responsive breakpoints at:
- 768px (tablets)
- 480px (mobile phones)

## Performance Considerations

- The parallax effects and 3D transforms are optimized for performance
- For older devices, consider reducing the number of floating particles
- The site uses hardware acceleration where possible via CSS transforms

## Future Enhancements

- Add more complex 3D models using CSS
- Implement WebGL for more advanced 3D rendering
- Add physics-based interactions
- Optimize performance for mobile devices
- Add accessibility features for screen readers
